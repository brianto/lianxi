吹啊吹讓這風吹
抹乾眼眸裡亮晶的眼淚
吹啊吹讓這風吹
哀傷通通帶走管風裡是誰
從風沙初起想到是季節變更
夢中醒卻歲月如飛奔
是否早訂下來你或我也會變心
慨嘆怎麼會久合終要分
狂風吹得起勁朗月也要被敝隱
泛起一片迷濛塵埃滾
掠走心裡一切美夢帶去那歡欣
帶去我的愛只是獨留恨

Pretty natural cool breeze gently blowing into my skirt
Summer stolen hear voices
Hurried times of the day so I have many emotions raw
Miss it a colorful scene
Wind gently blowing you stepping up my heart
Interest in an inter-changed my life
We are unable to pay as much enthusiasm was really count
But also do not need to frighten the storm invasion
Let this wind blowing blowing ah
Dry eyes in bright crystal tears
Let this wind blowing blowing ah
Sadly all who take the wind pipe
From the beginning of thought is sandstorm season change
Dreams of flying but as the years
Whether early or I will set down your change of heart
A long lament how will eventually be divided
Stormy wind enthusiastically Brightness should be spacious hidden
Misty dust thrown up a roll
Made off with all my heart that dreams bring joy
Bring my love just hate being left unattended

The storm brings back my meories
Like a boat searching for a harbor
Just couldn't forget you
Love's wish, love's aftertaste
It's hard to recollect past love
The flower in the wind fears withering
I am willing to bless you
I love you, my heart alreay belongs to you
This life is unwavering
In my heart, there is no one

I love you, you've paid the true meaning
